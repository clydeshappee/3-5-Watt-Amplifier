These are the files for the 3-5 watt amplifier from Motorola Motorola AN-422.

This design has NOT been built to these files, but a previous revision has.

The differences are:

1. A wiring error was corrected.

2. The power input was changed from screw terminals to a barrel jack.


As of this writing, all information here is believed to be correct, 
but build at your own risk!

The films were sent to Osh Park who kindly corrected an issue with 
the drill files and reviewe the films in general, so they should be
good to go.  YMMV.


One note about the input, the 3.5 mm jack is stereo and sums the two input
channels.  In this way I can power a single speaker on my computer
which I do with the previous design.  Operating from a 12 V supply, there
is plenty of audio.  If you want stereo, obviously build up two boards and 
use the screw terminal inputs for each amplifier.

If you build this design, please drop me a line so I can hear about your success.
